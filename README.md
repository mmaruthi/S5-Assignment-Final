# S5-Assignment-Final

MNIST - Pytorch - Creation of model and getting accuracy of 99.4 in 5 steps by improving model in each step.

Step 1:
Targets:   

           To have a basic skeleton with a good model.
           
           Params should be less than 15k. 
           
           Aim to max pool having a look at the data 
Results:   Params - 13590 ,     
           Best Train acc: 99.40 
           Best Test acc : 98.77
Analysis:   Model is fine.   
            Results came well . 
            But there is slight over fitting . 
            And model has to be improved.
