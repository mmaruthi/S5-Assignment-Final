# S5-Assignment-Final

MNIST - Pytorch - Creation of model and getting accuracy of 99.4 in 5 steps by improving model in each step.

Step 1:
Targets:   

           To have a basic skeleton with a good model.
           Params should be less than 15k. 
           Aim to max pool having a look at the data 
           
Results:   
           
           Params - 13590 ,  
           Best Train acc: 99.40 
           Best Test acc : 98.77
           
Analysis:   
            
            Model is fine.  
            Results came well . 
            But there is slight over fitting . 
             And model has to be improved.

Step 2 :

Targets:   

        Params should be less than 15k. 
        Use Batch Normalization to improve the model 
        
Results:
        
        Params - 13730 ,    
        Best Train acc: 99.81
        Best Test acc : 99.31
        
Analysis:   

        Results  improved
        But there is over fitting . Has  to reduce it.
        And model has to be taken care to reduce parameters
